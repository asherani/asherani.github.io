  Hey! Thanks for checking out my blog! I'm going to share all of the cool data science projects I do here. [Email me](mailto:sheraniaiman@gmail.com) what you think!
</p>


Aspiring Data Scientist. Fresh out of academia. Interests include physics, running, and trying to make the world make sense to me by quantify anything and everything.

To see the code for the previous projects I've worked on, go to [my GitHub page](https://github.com/asherani).

This is my [Resume](https://github.com/asherani/asherani.github.io/blob/master/Resume_AS.pdf).

## Setup

* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Atom](https://atom.io/), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)

Have questions/suggestions/insights? I would love to hear them. Feel free to [email me!](mailto:sheraniaiman@gmail.com).

Thanks for reading!
